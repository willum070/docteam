<h1>Welcome to CodaLab.</h1>

<p>CodaLab is an open-source web-based platform that enables researchers, developers, and data scientists to collaborate, with the goal of advancing research fields where machine learning and advanced computation is used. CodaLab helps to solve many common problems in the arena of data-oriented research through its online community where people can share worksheets and participate in competitions.</p>

<h2>Competitions</h2>

<p>CodaLab competitions provide an opportunity for researchers, developers and algorithmists to create solutions for problems across a wide range of domains. In a typical competition, participants work to find the best approach for a particular problem by crafting an algorithm against "training" data. The participant can then submit their solution where it is evaluated against "competition" data. Results from all participants are compiled and displayed on a leaderboard.</p>

<h3>Enter a Competition</h3>

<p>Put your skills to the test by participating in a competition. To see a list of ongoing competitions, visit <a href="codalab.org/competitions/">http://www.codalab.org/competitions</a>. To sign up for a competition, visit the detail page for the competition you want to enter, and click the <strong>Participate</strong> tab.</p>

<h3>Host a Competition</h3>

<p>Have a problem related to machine learning, medical imaging, or other field involving advanced computation? Organize a competition and call forth the talents of community members from far and wide! Visit the <a href="https://github.com/codalab/codalab/wiki#competitions">CodaLab Wiki</a> to learn more about hosting a competition.</p>

<h2>Worksheets</h2>

<p>CodaLab worksheets combine code execution, text, mathematics, plots and rich media into a single document, streamlining the research process and lowering the barrier to documenting and publishing detailed advanced computational research. You can use CodaLab worksheets to experiment and collaborate. Visit the <a href="https://github.com/codalab/codalab/wiki#worksheets">CodaLab Wiki</a> to learn more about worksheets.</p>

<h2>Developers: Contribute your Skills</h2>

<p>Join the CodaLab community and use your skills to evolve CodaLab! Visit the <a href="https://github.com/codalab/codalab/wiki#developers">CodaLab Wiki</a> to learn how to set up your development environment and start developing with CodaLab. </p></section>
