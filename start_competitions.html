    <h2>About Competitions</h2>
<p>CodaLab competitions provide an opportunity for researchers, developers and algorithmists to create solutions for problems across a wide range of domains. In a typical competition, participants work to find the best approach for a particular problem by crafting an algorithm against "training" data. The participant can then submit their solution where it is evaluated against "competition" data. Results from all participants are compiled and displayed on a leaderboard.</p>

<h3>Enter a Competition</h3>

<p>Put your skills to the test by participating in a competition. To see a list of ongoing competitions, visit <a href="codalab.org/competitions/">http://www.codalab.org/competitions</a>. To sign up for a competition, visit the detail page for the competition you want to enter, and click the <strong>Participate</strong> tab.</p>

<h2>How Competitions Work</h2>

<p>CodaLab competitions can be set up in several different ways. There are four main templates for competitions which we will refer to throughout the documentation. Competition models are differentiated primarily by the type of data to be evaluated, and the method of evaluation. They are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Pi:</strong> The simplest template, named for the subject matter of our demo competition. With the <strong>Pi</strong> template, competitors submit an answer which is compared with the known correct answer. Scores are then ranked according to their difference from the correct answer.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Computer Vision:</strong> Similar to the Pi template, except that the <strong>Computer Vision</strong> template compares image-based data rather than straight numeric or text values.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Basic Machine Learning:</strong> With the basic ML template, each competitor is provided with a set of training data which they can use to create a machine learning prediction. Each competitor then submits their prediction, which is then run against known correct answers and ranked.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Complete Machine Learning:</strong> With this template competitors are provided with a set of training data which they can use to create an algorithm. This algorithm is then used to produce a prediction, which is compared with the gold standard. Scores are ranked according to their difference from the gold standard.</p></li>
</ul>
